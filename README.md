# 👁️ Peek-A-Pupil – Gesture-Controlled Horror Eye 👁️

Peek-A-Pupil is a **horror-themed, interactive web app** where a monstrous eye tracks your real-time hand gestures using your webcam. Powered by **MediaPipe** and **JavaScript**, it responds to palm movement, blinks when you fist, and turns red when you point — creating a truly creepy and immersive experience.
